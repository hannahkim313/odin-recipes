# odin-recipes

This project will demonstrate my basic understanding of HTML by creating a recipe website.

I will...

* Use a Git/Github workflow
* Create an organized file structure
* Implement basic HTML tags such as:
    * Headings
    * Paragraphs
    * Unordered and ordered lists
    * Absolute and relative links
