# odin-recipes

This project exercise, created by The Odin Project, is a recipe index containing 3 different recipes:

* Sheepherder's Breakfast
* Baked Salmon
* Tiramisu

The recipe index (index.html) contains links to each recipe (breakfast.html, salmon.html,
and tiramisu.html), respectively. Each webpage was designed using HTML and CSS to
demonstrate a basic understanding of web design; however, some additional research was
conducted to achieve a more stylized layout.
