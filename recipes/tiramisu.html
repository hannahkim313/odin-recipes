            <ol class="text">
                <li>First start by adding the cream, sugar and vanilla to the stand mixer bowl.
                    Whip until stiff peaks form.</li>
                <li>Add in the room temperature mascarpone cheese and mix it in with the cream.
                    Don't over-mix, we want to mix it just until it is well incorporated. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Pour the cooled down espresso in a shallow bowl. Dip in the lady fingers quickly
                    and place them in a single layer at the bottom of the 8Ã—8 baking pan.</li>
                <li>Smooth out half the mascarpone mixture over the top then repeat the process of dipping
                    the lady fingers in the espresso and placing them over the mascarpone mixture in a single layer.</li>
                <li>Top the lady fingers with the mascarpone mixture one more time, smooth it out over the top and
                    dust the cocoa powder over the top of the tiramisu generously.</li>
                <li>Place the tiramisu in the fridge for 3 hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy your lazy girl tiramisu recipe!</li>
